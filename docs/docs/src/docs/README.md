# Introduction

GlitchyPastePen is an online tool that allows you to create and test HTML, CSS and Javascript code snippets with an online code editor & hosting. GlitchyPastePen is very much like CodePen, allowing only three primary files at once (an `index.html`, a `style.css` and a `script.js`), all of which are automatically linked, allowing you to quickly get started coding!

Being a project which is just a few months old, GlitchyPastePen is in continuous development by its two maintainers. More exciting features are added whenever we can! 

This is the documentation regarding GlitchyPastePen v2.0 (which is WIP). View GlitchyPastePen v1.0 [here](https://glitchypastepen.glitch.me).
